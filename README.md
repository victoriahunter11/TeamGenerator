# TeamGenerator
This app was created so that you can enter information about your individuals at work, and then build a team. After the questions are answered, it will result in collecting each team member's information and display it on an html page. This was created by using Node.js, CSS, HTML, and Inquirer.

Here is what the page looks like when you are answering questions:
